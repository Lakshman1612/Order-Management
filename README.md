**Order Management System using Salesforce**

In many organizations, the process of creating, approving, and managing client orders is manual and error-prone.
•	Sales teams face difficulty in handling orders and checking product stock.
•	Business managers struggle to monitor approvals and track order progress.
•	Support teams lack visibility into order status and client communication.
This results in delayed approvals, stock mismatches, and reduced customer satisfaction.
A Salesforce-based Order Management CRM can streamline the order-to-invoice cycle by automating approvals, updating product inventory in real-time, and providing dashboards for business insights.
